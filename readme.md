# Backend Library

### _Concepts and definitions_

Made to simulate a backend and replace using json server.

## Tech

Backend Library uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- node.js - evented I/O for the backend;
- Express - fast node.js network app framework. Used to make the creation and management of routes and requests more flexible;
- Nodemon - library used to automate any project update;
- Middleware - Handle requests before they are handled by the routes themselves.

## Installation

Backend Library requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm i
```

How to start

```sh
npm run dev
```

the index.js in app.listen the new port number

```sh
app.listen(3333, () -> {
 console.log('Server Started on port 3333ğŸ’€')
});
```
